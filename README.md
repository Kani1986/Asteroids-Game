This is my very first forray into python pygame.

Welcome to Asteroids, with pygame!

Player movement:
- W      - Accelerate
- A      - Turn Left
- S      - Decelerate
- D      - Turn Right
- SPACE  - Shoot

To Do:
- Add scoring system
- Add power-ups
- make asteroids more asteroid like instead of circles
- better collision detection on player
- make the background into a starfield
